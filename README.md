# Formula-1-Driver-Analyzer
A JavaScript web application that uses the D3.js library to create a visual environment where a user can learn about the performance of Formula 1 drivers and their place in the sportâ€™s history. 


<b>Features:</b>
- Choose a Formula 1 driver from 1994 to the 2020 season!
- Interact with coordinated visualizations that focus on the aspects of a driver's career that are of particular interest, such as points obtained, wins/losses against their teammates, placements and DNFs!
- Only interested in the period when the driver was driving for a particular constructor? Only interested in the stats from a specific track? Use filters to focus on only the information you seek!


<b>Comments:</b><br/>
After my previous work where I successfully used Data Integration techniques to build a huge database of Formula 1 statistics (https://github.com/IlNin/Formula-1-Data-Management-Project), I just couldn't let those juicy stats go to waste.
So for my Visual Analytics project I decided to create an application that could showcase my integrated data in a way that a user can easily interact with it and gain some insights from the drivers they are interested in. Thankfully my professor was a huge Formula 1 fan as well, so he could give a lot of well thought suggestions that helped me to focus on the right areas when working on this project, and for that I thank him so much!
